# System & Network Security Implementation Concepts

This project showcases the practical work I completed on key system and network security implementations. I used Splunk Enterprise for log collection and analysis, enabled BitLocker to encrypt sensitive data, and configured Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for improved access security.

### 1. Splunk Enterprise Setup & Log Collection
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on a virtual machine.
- Configured the Splunk Web interface and adjusted data input settings.
- Installed a Splunk Universal Forwarder on a client machine.
- Set up the forwarder to send Windows Event Logs to the Splunk server.
- Verified that log data was being received and visualized within the Splunk dashboard.

### 2. Encrypting Sensitive Data with BitLocker
- Enabled the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature on a Windows Server.
- Encrypted a secondary local drive using BitLocker with TPM (Trusted Platform Module) protection.
- Stored the recovery key securely and confirmed encryption through the BitLocker status check.

### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Configured MFA on a Windows user account using Microsoft Authenticator.
- Linked my phone for push notification-based authentication.
- Successfully tested MFA login flow and recovery options.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Deploy and configure a basic Splunk Enterprise environment.
- Forward logs from a client machine to Splunk for real-time monitoring.
- Secure local drives using BitLocker encryption.
- Implement and test MFA for enhanced authentication security.
